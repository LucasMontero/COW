	  <h2>Installation and configuration</h2>
	  <p>There are 4 steps you must follow during the installation process.</p>

	  <h5><b>1. Make sure that your server has MongoDB, Nodejs and npm installed.</b></h5>

	  <p>COW needs these programs to run. You can find a MongoDB installation guide <a href="https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/">here</a>
		and a NodeJS installation packages <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.
		Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so
		you'll want to make sure it's the latest version.</p>

	  <h5><b>2. Copy the "cow" folder on your server and install its depencies with "npm install".</b></h5>

	  <p>Donwload cow files compressed here and deploy it on your server, then move to the destination folder and execute the command “npm install” to install all the dependencies required to run COW.</p>

	  <h5><b>3. Set your server information to the "config.js" file.</b></h5>

	  <p>Inside the COW folder exist a file named “config.js” inside it you can configure where  port do you want to be used for run the application and the route to your MongoDB server.</p>

	  <h5><b>4. Start using cow</b></h5>
	  <p>Open your web browser and run COW in the assigned port, go to admin panel on <b>http://your-domain/cow-adm</b> and then log in with the default user “admin@cow.com” with password “plschanguethis”. After doing that, go to the user page administrator and changue this credentials.</p>

	  <h2>Configure COW on Nginx</h2>
	  <p>You can configure Nginx as a proxy server to run multiple cow apps you can find how to install it in your server here.</p>
 	  <p>You have to make a custom VirtualHost configuration file and we change its content for the following.</p>
	  <div class="shell">
	  <pre>
		server {
		  listen 80;
		  server_name <b>domain_name</b>;
		  location <b>/</b> {
			 proxy_pass http://<b>127.0.0.1</b>:<b>app_port</b>;
			 proxy_http_version 1.1;
			 proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
			 proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
			 proxy_set_header Host $host;
			 proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
		  }
		}
	 </pre>
	  </div>
		<p>Restart your Nginx server to load the changes.</p>
	  <p>You can add any app as you want to your server by creating news virtualhosts and assing diferent port to any app.</p>
