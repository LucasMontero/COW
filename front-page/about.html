	  <h2>About</h2>
	  <p>
			COW is a web application based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(software_bundle)" target="_blank">MEAN</a> that allows developers to create and maintain their web pages directly on their hosting by
			modifying HTML, CSS and Javascript directly from the browser.
	  </p>
		<p>
			With this project, we want to offer an alternative to traditional CMS, that made dificult to enter directly into the code, facilitating
			the process of developing a static web page.
		</p>
	   <p>
			 COW was developed as a final project to Web Development associate degree on <a href="http://www.edu.xunta.gal/centros/iesmurallaromana/">I.E.S Muralla Romana</a> by Lucas Montero
			 and Jorge Fern√°ndez.
